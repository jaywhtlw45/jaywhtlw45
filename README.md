## üèóÔ∏è *Before Tech*

I come from a background in **construction** where I spent years solving real-world problems, reading blueprints, and building parts for complex projects. I also worked in sales management for over a decade, where I developed leadership skills and built strong relationships with clients and teams.

## üçñ *Outside of Code*

When I‚Äôm not writing code, you‚Äôll probably find me at the grill or spending time with my family. I take BBQ seriously.
