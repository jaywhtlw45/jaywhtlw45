## 👨‍💻 Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer | Tech-Driven Problem Solver

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a passionate developer focused on building meaningful software — from AI-powered tools to full stack web applications. With a background in both **Computer Science** and **Cybersecurity**, I bring a strong technical foundation and a practical, solution-oriented mindset to every project.

### 🛠️ Current Projects
- **Level Up** – A full stack workout tracker built from the ground up with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. Frontend development is currently underway.
- **Meet in the Middle** – A TypeScript + **Next.js** backend project using **MongoDB** and **Mongoose**, built to help users find optimal meeting locations.
- **Brain Tumor Classification** – Leveraged **CNNs** to classify MRI scans for early tumor detection.
- **Facial Recognition Analysis** – Implemented facial analysis using **Facebook DeepFace** and **Google ArcFace** models.
- **Tic Tac Toe over LAN** – A C++ socket programming project with three networked gameplay milestones (AI, peer-to-peer, and server-client).
- **Finance DBMS** – Built a financial management system using SQL for storing and querying transactions.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Deep diving into **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Transitioning to **Python** soon for backend scripting and data projects.

### 🔧 Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C++, SQL
- **Frameworks:** Next.js, Mongoose, Express
- **Tools:** VSCode, Git, MongoDB

### 👷 Before Tech
I come from a background in **construction management**, where I learned to lead teams, solve tough logistical problems, and get things done under pressure — all of which now power my work as a developer.

### 🍖 Outside of Code
When I’m not at my computer, I’m probably at the grill or spending time with my family. BBQ is serious business.
